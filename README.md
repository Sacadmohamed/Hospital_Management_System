# Hospital_Management_System
This project is about a Hospital Management System, where doctors, along with their professions and addresses, are registered. You can also register patients. Then, you book an appointment for the patient by assigning him or her to the referred doctor. Additionally, there is a tab where you can view appointments in order.
